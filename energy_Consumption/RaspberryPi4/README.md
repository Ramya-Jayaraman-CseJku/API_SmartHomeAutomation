#### Energy Consumption of the microcontrollers

we are measuring the energy consumption of the microcontrollers with the INA219 current sensor.

##### Raspberrypi

Install the adafruit library for the current sensor INA219 with the command 

``sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ina219``

After successful installation, copy paste and run the [code](https://github.com/Ramya-Jayaraman-CseJku/DT_API/blob/main/energy_Consumption/RaspberryPi4/energyConsumption.py) in raspberrypi. The program displays the voltage, current and power.
