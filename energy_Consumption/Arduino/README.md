#### Energy Consumption of the microcontrollers

we are measuring the energy consumption of the microcontrollers with the INA219 current sensor.

##### Arduino UNO

Install the adafruit library for the current sensor INA219 from tools-> libraries  and search for adafruit ina219 and install the following library.

``Adafruit INA219 by Adafruit``

After successful installation, copy paste and run the [code](https://github.com/Ramya-Jayaraman-CseJku/DT_API/energy_Consumption/Arduino/currentArduino.ino). The program displays the voltage, current and power.
